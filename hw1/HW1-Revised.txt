A new/JJ psychology study suggests that some forms of “positive thinking” have limited/JJ value in the fight against depression — and could even be a hindrance.
The research, published in the journal Psychological Science, found people who fantasized about an idealized/JJ future tended to have fewer depressive/JJ symptoms in the present, but faced more depressive/JJ symptoms in the future.

“The modern/JJ era is marked by a push for ever-positive thinking, and the self-help market fueled by a reliance on such positive thinking is a $9.6 billion industry that continues to grow. Our findings raise questions of how costly/JJ this market may be for people’s long-term/JJ well-being and for society as a whole,” researcher Gabriele Oettingen and her colleagues wrote in their study.

The researchers used questionnaires and daily/JJ diaries in four separate/JJ studies to examine the relationship between positive fantasies about the future and depressive/JJ symptoms in college students and children.

The first study of 88 college students found the more positively/JJ participants fantasized about the future, the fewer/JJ symptoms of depression they showed in the present, but the more/JJ symptoms they showed one month later. 

The second study replicated the first, but with a sample size greater than that of the first study, a younger/JJ sample, and a longer/JJ timeframe. This second/JJ study of 109 fourth- and fifth-grade children found the more positively the children fantasized about the future, the fewer/JJ symptoms of depression they showed at in the present, but the more/JJ symptoms of depression they showed 7 months later.

“___ than” is a scenario where an adjective would fail the specifications. For example, the adjective “greater” in “greater than” would not be marked as such. 

Additionally, the rule where an adjective have an “s” appended to it (be a plural) fails when applied to words like “positive,” where the words double as nouns and adjectives.

The new specifications tagged several more words as adjectives, most notably instances of “positive” and instances of comparative words such as “greater.” This leads to a more accurate tagging that improved recall by ~20% and reduced the number of missed tags entirely.
