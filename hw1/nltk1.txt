A new/JJ psychology study suggests that some forms of “positive/JJ thinking” have limited/JJ value in the fight against depression — and could even be a hindrance.
The research, published in the journal Psychological Science, found people who fantasized about an idealized/JJ future tended to have fewer depressive/JJ symptoms in the present, but faced more depressive/JJ symptoms in the future.
“The modern/JJ era is marked by a push for ever-positive/JJ thinking, and the self-help market fueled by a reliance on such positive/JJ thinking is a $9.6 billion industry that continues to grow. Our findings raise questions of how costly/JJ this market may be for people’s long-term/JJ well-being and for society as a whole,” researcher Gabriele Oettingen and her colleagues wrote in their study.
The researchers used questionnaires and daily/JJ diaries in four separate/JJ studies to examine the relationship between positive/JJ fantasies about the future and depressive/JJ symptoms in college/JJ students and children.
The first study of 88 college/JJ students found the more positively participants fantasized about the future, the fewer/JJ symptoms of depression they showed in the present, but the more/JJ symptoms they showed one month later.

The specification "The noun is ___" is not accurate for all adjectives. For example, the adjective daily does not fit this rule. This specification needs to be modified or removed, however I haven't found a suitable modification yet.

The specifications "cannot become a plural" and "cannot be the subject of 'is'" do not hold well for words like "college," which are technically adjectives (albeit an uncommon forms), as "colleges" and "college is" are a valid phrases (noun). This specification should be modified, however I haven't found a consistent new manner in which to do so.
